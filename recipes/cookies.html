        <h4>Cookies are the perfect way to load your family up with sugar to get them to crash in an hour or two!</h4>
        <p>These cookies were often the only time we ever received something sweet when I was a child. As it turns out, empty calories and sweets 
            just don't always fit into an already tight budget, so most of the time it was plain bread and hard cheese. Around the holidays my
            mom would always pull extra shifts at the steel mill so that we could have some cookies available when family came to town. Of course, 
            we all only got a quarter of a cookie each, but it was still the highlight of our years!
        </p>
        <p>To make these cookies, you will probably just need to run to the store to get the couple materials. Hopefully that won't be as much of 
            a burden for you as it was for us, but if it is, I know a great employer that is always looking for people to lose fingers in the 
            pursuit of manufacturing quality building material!
