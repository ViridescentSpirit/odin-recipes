        <h4>Garlic bread is the perfect side for a nice warm plate of dog lasagna, give it a try the next time you get the family all together!</h4>
        <p>This garlic bread was a staple when we couldn't afford anything but bread, butter, and cheese. It's super simple and pretty much idiot can 
            accomplish getting it put together. When done correctly, it gives you the perfect level of garlic breath to really bother everyone around
            you, so when you need a quiet night to be left alone, this should be your go to!
        </p>
        <p>To make this meal, you will need a little bit of time (seriously, it's just bread) and almost no patience. You can easily accomplish this
            while dealing with your awful kids and ungrateful partner. After eating, you will smell so horrible that they won't even want to spend a 
            minute with you! Enjoy the tiny amount of alone time you actually get, because as we all know, it won't last long and you'll be back to 
            your miserable existence.
