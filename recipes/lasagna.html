        <h4>Lasagna is a staple meal for many families, and it's layered pasta, cheese, and meat will be an instant hit for your dinner table!</h4>
        <p>This lasagna recipe was great when dad was able to bring home just enough to actually buy meat, cheese, AND pasta all in the same week.
            It was great as a once or twice a year treat, and one time, we even had to use dog meat just to get the sweet, sweet taste of lasagna
            in our mouths. I'm so happy to be able to afford a computer today to be able to share these wonderful memories with each of you.
        </p>
        <p>To make this meal, you will need to make sure that you can also afford pasta, meat, and cheese. If you are truly affluent you can also
            add some fresh herbs and extra sauce to get that really messy style lasagna that you will just love to clean off the walls when your child
            starts throwing it from the high chair! Don't forget to scrape it off the walls to keep it with the leftovers, and don't worry, lead paint
            is so 1960, so there's really no hazard if a couple of paint flakes get into your meal.

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>This is a super easy meal that people have been making for generations, so if you manage to mess this up, I bet you're gonna just be 
            disappointing a family that is already fed up with your bullshit. Good luck, and may the odds be ever in <em>your favor.</em>
        </p>
        <ol class="instructionlist">
            <li>Gather your ingredients, if you forget anything your lasagna will be terrible and your children will despise you.</li>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch over over medium heat until well browned.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian 
                seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and 
                rinse with cold water.
            </li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, reamining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat 
                sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over
                mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. If you fail at these simple tasks, your lasagna will fall apart, much like your 
                life did after you peaked in high school.
            </li>
            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with 
                cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving to your ungrateful family. Eat with a thousand yard stare while contemplating the sweet 
                embrace of death you so long for.
            </li>
