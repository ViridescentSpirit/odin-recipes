TOP Recipe Website Project

With this project I will be creating a simple recipe
management website to showcase my new HTML skills. I 
will then use the skill I learn for CSS to style and
design it so that it doesn't look totally barbaric
(much like Wizard's Chess) and instead matches what
most normal humans would prefer to look at. Of course,
I'm also going to use it as an opportunity to write out
my entire life story so that anyone looking at the recipes
has to hear about all that before making their meal.
